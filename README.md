# rgzip: a gzip decompressor in Rust

I'm following the gzip/deflate RFCs to write a complete gzip decompressor from scratch, while learning Rust in the process.

This is my first Rust program, *code reviews are welcome* .

### How to use it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricbit/rgzip.git
cd rgzip
cargo run inputfile outputfile
```
